//
// Common macros that don't require procedural macro functionality

// This module will contain macros that are used commonly but don't require
// the complexity of procedural macros. These include simple utility macros,
// helper macros, and formatting macros.

// Note: Most complex macros should go in the rust-macros crate instead.
